# Part 1: Basics

> The following examples should give you a first look at what R does and how it works. 

## Introduction

R is a command-line program, which means commands are entered line-by-line at the prompt. Being a programming language it is very finicky. Everything has to be entered exactly right - including case-sensitivity. So, a `Plot` entry is different from `plot`!

There are two ways of entering commands (telling R to do a certain thing): either typing them out carefully into the "Console Window" (the lower-left window in Rstudio) and hitting `Enter` or writing and editing lines in the script window (upper-left window in Rstudio), and "passing" the code into the console by hitting `Ctrl+Enter`.

In general, it is better to do all of your coding in a script window, and then save the raw code file as a text document, which you can revisit and re-run at any point later. To create a new R script document, go to the upper-left corner, press `File` - `New file` - `R Script` or press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `N`

## R is a calculator

```{r}
1+2
3^6
sqrt((20-19)^2 + (19-19)^2 + (19-18)^2)/2
12345*54312
```

## Assigning variable names

The assignment operator is `<-`. It's supposed to look like an arrow pointing left (the shortcut for entering it is `Alt` + `-`).

```{r}
X <- 5  	# sets X equal to 5 
```

Using the assignment operator sets the value of `X` but doesn't print any output. To see what `X` is, you need to type:

```{r}
X
```

Note that `X` now appears in the upper-right panel of Rstudio, letting you know that there is now an object in memory (also called the "Environment") called `X`. 

Now, you can use `X` as if it were a number

```{r}
X*2
X^X
``` 

Note that you can name a variable ANYTHING, as long as it starts with a letter.
```{r}
Fred <- 5
Nancy <- Fred*2
Fred + Nancy
```

## Vectors

Obviously, `X` can be many things more than just a single number. The most important kind of object in R is a "vector", which is a series of inputs (and therefore resembles "data").  

`c()` is a function - a very useful function that creates "vectors". In all functions, arguments are passed within parentheses. 

We can use the `c()` function as follows:

```{r}
X <- c(3,4,5)  	# sets X equal to the vector (3,4,5)
X
```

Now, let's do some arithmetic with this vector:
```{r}
X + 1
X*2
X^2
((X+X^2/2)/X)^2
```

Note that in all of these cases, the arithmetic operations are performed on a term-by-term basis.

We can very quickly look at some exponential growth (e.g. using Washington sea otter numbers: N0 = 60, 50 years gone by, and an annual growth rate of 7%. Now, a growth rate of 7% means that it is 7% *more* than the original number, which is 100% (or 1).  

```{r}
years <- 0:60
lambda <- 1.07
N0 <- 50
N0*lambda^years
```

## Exercise 1: Calculate population growth

> You can get some really quick population growth answers this way.  Compute how many sea otters there will be by 2050 and 2100 (80 and 130 years after release).  *HINT: you can just replace the vector with a single number*. 

</font>

## Multiple Vectors and Data Frames

Data is most often multiple vectors of the same length. If we create a second vector `Y` we can use it alongside our first vector `X` using the `data.frame()` command. Now, both vectors became columns in our new data frame!

```{r}
Y <- c(1,2,3)
data.frame(X,Y)
```

Running that command as a single line just outputs the data and allows us to look at it. To perform operations with it, you should save it as another object:

```{r}
mydata <- data.frame(X,Y)
```

A data frame has columns with names:

```{r}
ncol(mydata) # ncol() gives us a number of columns that this data frame has
names(mydata) # names() lists all column names that this data frame has 
```
A column can be extracted (or called) from a dataframe with a `$`:

```{r}
mydata$X
mydata$Y
```

# Part 2: Loading and Exploring Data

> The following examples should explain how to import data frames and to work with the data contained within them. 

## Loading Data

We will use Steller sea lion (*Eumotopias jubatus*) data as an example.  These are weights, lengths, and girths (basically, under the arm/flipper pits) of sea lion pups about two months after birth as part of a tagging mark-recapture study.  These data were collected (in part by Dr. Gurarie) on five islands in the Russian North Pacific.  

This is what sea lion pups look like: 

![](pups_small.jpg)

This dataset is available on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.syracuse.edu/ultra/courses/_492502_1/cl/outline) as `SeaLions.csv`, or at [this link](SeaLions.csv).   Once you download it, you can use the File Explorer to determine its location and read it into R in a couple of ways:

1. **From the command line:** you can download the dataset and modify the following line of code:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
SeaLions <- read.csv("SeaLions.csv")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
SeaLions <- read.csv("insert the directory instead of this sentence/SeaLions.csv")
```

A directory is another way to refer to a folder or, simply, a location of a data file on your computer. You can get the address of the directory if you open the folder where you saved the file through File Explorer, right-click on the navigation bar and select `Copy address as text` option. Note: If you copy and paste the file directory in, you **have to change the direction of the slashes** from `\` to `/`! 

Note that `csv` is a **text based** file type (Comma Separated Values) - it just means that commas between entries indicate separate columns.  When a program "reads" the file, it "knows" that a comma means the end of one column and the start of another one. You can save any Excel file as a `csv` using the **Save As** function. CSVs are by far the the most common and convenient file type used for loading into R.

2. Alternatively, you can import datasets into `R` using the `RStudio` point-and-click interface. To do this:

> 1. Navigate to the `Files` tab in the bottom right corner of RStudio
> 2. Click on `SeaLions.csv`
> 3. RStudio will prompt you to either view the file or import the dataset. You want to import, so hit `Import File`
> 4. A pop-up window will appear, showing you the preview of the data frame. Click `Import` and observe that your file is now loaded - it should have appeared in your Environment in the top right corner of RStudio. 

This method does the same exact thing as the line of code above. It will automatically input the proper code into the console and save your file to the environment. Note that by default the file will have the same name rather than a name you designate for it.

## Working with data frames

Look at some properties of this data file, with the following functions:

```{r}
is(SeaLions) # tells what type of files we have
names(SeaLions) # tells us the names of all the columns
head(SeaLions) # shows the first several rows of the dataframe
```

Use a `$` to extract a given column:

```{r}
Length <- SeaLions$Length
Weight <-SeaLions$Weight
Island <- SeaLions$Island
Sex <- SeaLions$Sex
```

## Summary Statistics 

Some basic summary statistics include:

```{r}
range(Length) # range
median(Length) # median
mean(Length) # mean
var(Length) # variance
sd(Length) # standard deviation
```

## Graphical Summaries

### Histogram

A histogram (invoked by `hist()` command) can show us the distribution of a single continuous variable:

```{r, echo = -1}
par(mfrow = c(1,2)) 
hist(Length)
hist(Weight)
```

### Boxplot

A boxplot shows us relationships between a continuous variable (like Length/Weight/Girth) and a discrete variable (like Island/Sex):

```{r, echo = -1}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
boxplot(Length ~ Island)
boxplot(Weight ~ Sex)
```

### Scatterplot

A scatterplot shows us relationships between two continuous variables:

```{r, echo = -1}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(Length, Weight)
```

## Exercise 2: Download and plot the sea otter population growth data

> The first step is to import our new dataset. It is calles `SeaOtters.csv` and is [here](SeaOtters.csv) or on [Blackboard](https://blackboard.syracuse.edu/ultra/courses/_492502_1/cl/outline). Perform the same steps as we did with the sea lions one 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
SeaOtters <- read.csv("SeaOtters.csv")
```

> Plot the downloaded data, using the "Year" column on the X-axis and "Count" column on the y-axis. Hint: you will need to extract these columns before plotting.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
plot(SeaOtters$year, SeaOtters$count)
```

</font>


# Part 3: Linear Models for Exponential Growth

> The following examples show you how to do a linear regression model and a log transformation model


## Extract variables and explore

```{r}
Year <- SeaOtters$year
Count <- SeaOtters$count
```

It's usually a good idea to run some summary statistics on each of your variables. Here's a couple examples

```{r}
range(Year)
quantile(Count)
```

Always, always, always PLOT your data before modeling your data!  

```{r}
plot(Year, Count)
```

It is quite easy to make plots on a log scale, by the way, which can be useful: 

```{r}
plot(Year, Count, log = "y")
```



## Linear Model

The `lm()` function produces a linear model.  That means it finds the "best" values for a model that looks likes this:

$$Y_i = \alpha + \beta\, X_i + \epsilon_i$$

Where $\alpha$ is the intercept, $\beta$ is the slope, and $\epsilon$ is the "residual" variation, i.e. a random variable: ${\cal N}(0, \sigma^2)$. 

In R this model is fitted as follows: 

```{r}
Model1 <- lm(Count ~ Year)
```

Note, we take a "model fit" (which is a complicated thing) and put it into a new object with name `Model1`.  

The output of `Model1` is just the estimated parameters for the intercept and the "Year effect" (i.e. slope of the curve). 

```{r}
Model1
```

There is a lot more information if you ask for a summary:

```{r}
summary(Model1)
```

Of importance to us is the `Estimate` (same as above) and the `Std. Error` which quantifies how precise our estimate is.  Two standard errors is (roughly) the same as a **95% Confidence Interval**.   Thus, the slope on this fit is 33.2 new sea otters / year &pm; 6.18.  This is definitely bigger than 0!  We can also see that because the *p*-value (under column `Pr(>|t|)`) is very very very very small.  

Note, also that $R^2 = 0.835$.  $R^2$ is between 0 and 1 and measures how tight the fit is, specifically it is the *proportion of the variance explained by the model*. 

We can plot this linear model on our data:

```{r}
plot(Year, Count)
abline(Model1)
```

<!-- Note, `abline` is a function that adds an intercept-slope line to any existing plot. 

 There are some problems with this model.  What are they? 

 You can see one issue if you plot the model residuals as follows: 

```{r}
# plot(Model1,1)
```

Do those residuals look consistently normally distributed?  -->

## Log Transformation

We kind of knew the growth was not linear (otherwise this week's topic wouldn't have been called *Exponential Growth*).  But how can we use a linear model to fit an exponential growth function?  

With a simple transformation! 

$$\log(Y_i) = \alpha + \beta\, X_i + \epsilon_i$$

How does this relate to an exponential growth model? 

$$e^{\log(Y_i)} = e^{\alpha + \beta\, X_i + \epsilon_i}$$
$$Y_t = N_0  e^{\beta\, X_t + \epsilon_t}$$

We just replaced $e^\alpha$ with $N_0$, and $i$ with $t$.  But $\beta$ is EXACTLY the growth rate $r$ (and $e^\beta = \lambda$).  The $\epsilon_i$ hanging on the end is a bit of stochasticity.  

Anyways, doing this with our linear modeling tools is easy.  We just wrap `Count` in a log.  

```{r}
Model2 <- lm(log(Count) ~ Year)
summary(Model2)
```

Note how our statistics changed.  Specifically: our $\beta$ estimate (which is also $r$) is now 0.07325, which is a good estimate of the intrinsic growth rate.  Even better, we know have a standard error around that estimate: 0.00237, which means our growth rate can be written as:  $\widehat{r} = (7.32 \pm 0.47)\times 10^{-2}$.  We can convert that to an annual growth rate in R as well (*do NOT worry about understanding the following code*:

```{r}
r.hat <- summary(Model2)$coefficients[2,1]
r.sd <- summary(Model2)$coefficients[2,2]
exp(c(r.hat, r.hat-2*r.sd, r.hat+2*r.sd))
```

So our estimate of annual population growth is 7.6% (95% Confidence Interval 7.1%-8.1%)


Note how much higher the $R^2$ value is! This is (by that measure also) a much better fit.  

Let's visualize the fit:

```{r}
plot(Year, log(Count))
abline(Model2)
```

Much better!

Let's make our final graph a little nicer

```{r}
plot(Year, log(Count), main = 'Sea Otter Population', col = 'brown', pch = 4)
abline(Model2, col = "blue")
```

The commands we're using within the `plot` function include setting the title of the graph (`main =`), changing the color of the symbols and the line (`col =`), and changing the shape of the symbols (`pch =`). There also many more alterations you can make to get your graph perfect - but that can be a deep dark `R`abbit hole!


<!--

### Check Your New Residuals

```{r}
# plot(Model2, 1)
```

 These look better!  (Though it takes practice to understand good vs. bad residuals.) -->



## Extra packages (optional material)

It can be a bit fussy to plot the confidence interval around our prediction.  Below, we include a little snippet of code which does just that, but you have to install a new "library" called `ggplot2`, which has a bunch of fancier graphing tools. 

To install a library, you use the `install.packages()` function: 
```{r eval = FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

You only need to install a package once on your computer. After that, it will always be there.

Alternatively, you can use the `R` interface to install new packages. To do so:

> Click the `Packages` tab in the bottom right window of `Rstudio` and  click `Install`
> ... or ... go to `Tools > Ìnstall Packages` in the menu bar. 
> In the blank "packages" line, start typing the name of the package you want. `RStudio` should automatically fill this in with suggestions. Use a comma to separate the names of multiple package if installing more than one simultaneously. 
> Click `Install`

This will automatically put the correct code in the console for you. 

From now on, whenever you need that package loaded you use the `library` function. You only have to do this once each time you open `R`, after that, a package stays in your library for the rest of your session.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

If you receive prewritten code from someone and open the file in `RStudio`, the software will automatically identify packages called by the `library` funtion. If you do not have these packages installed, `Rstudio` will ask you if you'd like to install them, which can save you time. However, you will still need to run the `library` function on each package before you can use them.

Now - **finally** - you have access to the funky / fancy library of ggplotting functions.  For example: 

```{r}
ggplot(SeaOtters, aes(Year, Count)) + geom_point() + 
    stat_smooth(method = "glm", 
                method.args = list(family = gaussian(link = "log")))
```

This really looks like a nice fit!

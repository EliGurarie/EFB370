# Part 1: Basics

> The following examples should give you a first look at what R does and how it works. 

## Introduction

R is a command-line program, which means commands are entered line-by-line at the prompt. Being a programming language it is very finicky. Everything has to be entered exactly right - including case-sensitivity.

There are two ways of entering commands: either typing them out carefully into the "Console Window" (the lower-left window in Rstudio) and hitting `Enter` or writing and editing lines in the script window (upper-left window in Rstudio), and "passing" the code into the console by hitting `Ctrl+Enter`.

In general, it is better to do all of your coding in a script window, and then save the raw code file as a text document, which you can revisit and re-run at any point later. 

## R is a calculator

```{r}
1+2
3^6
sqrt((20-19)^2 + (19-19)^2 + (19-18)^2)/2
12345*54312
```

## Assigning variable names

The assignment operator is `<-`. It's supposed to look like an arrow pointing left.

```{r}
X <- 5  	# sets X equal to 5
```

Using the assignment operator sets the value of `X` but doesn't print any output. To see what `X` is, you need to type:

```{r}
X
```

Note that `X` now appears in the upper-right panel of Rstudio, letting you know that there is now an object in memory (also called the "Environment") called `X`. 

Now, you can use `X` as if it were a number

```{r}
X*2
X^X
``` 

Note that you can name a variable ANYTHING, as long as it starts with a letter.
```{r}
Fred <- 5
Nancy <- Fred*2
Fred + Nancy
```

## Vectors

Obviously, `X` can be many things more than just a single number. The most important kind of object in R is a "vector", which is a series of inputs (and therefore resembles "data").  

`c()` is a function - a very useful function that creates "vectors". In all functions, arguments are passed within parentheses. 

We can use the `c()` function as follows:

```{r}
X <- c(3,4,5)  	# sets X equal to the vector (3,4,5)
X
```

Now, let's do some arithmetic with this vector:
```{r}
X + 1
X*2
X^2
((X+X^2/2)/X)^2
```

Note that in all of these cases, the arithmetic operations are performed on a term-by-term basis.

We can very quickly compute some exponential growth (e.g. using Washington sea otter numbers) this way:

```{r}
years <- 80
lambda <- 1.07
N0 <- 60
N0*lambda^years
```

### > **Exercise:**  You can get some really quick population growth answers this way.  Compute how many sea otters there will be by 2050 and 2100 (80 and 130 years after release).  *HINT: you can just replace the vector with a single number*. 


## Multiple Vectors

Data is most often multiple vectors of the same length. If we create a second vector `Y` we can use it alongside our first vector `X` using the `data.frame()` command: 

```{r}
Y <- c(1,2,3)
data.frame(X,Y)
```

That just outputs the data, but you should save it another object:

```{r}
mydata <- data.frame(X,Y)
```

A data frame has columns with names:

```{r}
ncol(mydata)
names(mydata)
```
A column can be extracted from a dataframe with a `$`:

```{r}
mydata$X
mydata$Y
```


### > **Exercise:**  Create a data frame called `myseaotters` that containes the number of years from 0 to 130 and the predicted population, starting at 60 animals with a lambda rate of 1.07. 


# Part 2: Loading and Exploring Data

> The following examples should explain how to import data frames and to work with the data contained within them. 

## Loading Data

We will use Steller sea lion (*Eumotopias jubatus*) data as an example.  These are weights, lengths, and girths (basically, under the arm/flipper pits) of sea lion pups about two months after birth as part of a tagging mark-recapture study.  These data were collected (in part by Dr. Gurarie) on five islands in the Russian North Pacific.  

This is what sea lion pups look like: 

![](pups_small.jpg)

This dataset is available on Blackboard. Once you download it, you can use the File Explorer to determine its location and read it into R.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
SeaLions <- read.csv("SeaLions.csv")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
SeaLions <- read.csv("<insert the directory>/SeaLions.csv")
```

If you copy and paste the file directory in, you have to change the direction of the slashes. Note that `csv` is a **text based** file type (Comma Separated Values) - it just means that commas between entries separate columns.  You can save any Excel file as a `csv` using the Save As function.  CSVs are by far the the most common and convenient file type used for loading into R.

Alternatively, you can import datasets into `R` using the `RStudio` interface. To do this:

> 1. Click `File`
> 2. Hover over `Import Dataset`
> 3. Select `From Text` (or if you're doing this with a different file type in the future, the matching type of file)
> 4. Navigate to the SeaLions dataset, highlight it, and click `open`

This will automatically input the proper code into the console and save your file to the environment. Note that the file has the same name rather than a name you designate for it.

## Working with data frames

Look at some properties of this data file, with the following functions:

```{r}
is(SeaLions) # tells what type of files we have
names(SeaLions) # tells us the names of all the columns
head(SeaLions) # shows the first several rows of the dataframe
```

Use a `$` to extract a given column:

```{r}
Length <- SeaLions$Length
Weight <-SeaLions$Weight
Island <- SeaLions$Island
Sex <- SeaLions$Sex
```

## Summary Statistics 

Some basic summary statistics include:

```{r}
range(Length) #range
median(Length) #median
mean(Length) #mean
var(Length) #variance
sd(Length) #standard deviation
```

## Graphical Summaries

### Histrogram

A histogram can show us the distribution of a single continuous variable:

```{r, echo = -1}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(Length)
hist(Weight)
```

### Boxplot

A boxplot shows us relationships between a continuous variable (like Length/Weight/Girth) and a discrete variable (like Island/Sex):

```{r, echo = -1}
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
boxplot(Length ~ Island)
boxplot(Weight ~ Sex)
```

### Scatterplot

A scatterplot shows us relationships between two continuous variables:

```{r, echo = -1}
plot(Length, Weight)
```

# Part 3: Linear Models for Exponential Growth

> The following examples show you how to do a linear regression model and a log transformation model

## Importing Data

The first step is to import our new dataset. This time with sea otters. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
SeaOtters <- read.csv("SeaOtters.csv")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
SeaOtters <- read.csv("<insert your directory>/SeaOtters.csv")
```

Let's double check that the data we imported matches our Excel file.

```{r}
head(SeaOtters)
```

## Extract variables and explore

```{r}
Year <- SeaOtters$year
Count <- SeaOtters$count
```

It's usually a good idea to run some summary statistics on each of your variables. Here's a couple examples

```{r}
range(Year)
quantile(Count)
```

Always, always, always PLOT your data before modeling your data!  

```{r}
plot(Year, Count)
```

It is quite easy to make plots on a log scale, by the way, which can be useful: 

```{r}
plot(Year, Count, log = "y")
```



## Linear Model

The `lm()` function produces a linear model.  That means it finds the "best" values for a model that looks likes this:

$$Y_i = \alpha + \beta\, X_i + \epsilon_i$$

Where $\alpha$ is the intercept, $\beta$ is the slope, and $\epsilon$ is the "residual" variation, i.e. a random variable: ${\cal N}(0, \sigma^2)$. 

In R this model is fitted as follows: 

```{r}
Model1 <- lm(Count ~ Year)
```

Note, we take a "model fit" (which is a complicated thing) and put it into a new object with name `Model1`.  

The output of `Model1` is just the estimated parameters for the intercept and the "Year effect" (i.e. slope of the curve). 

```{r}
Model1
```

There is a lot more information if you ask for a summary:

```{r}
summary(Model1)
```

Of importance to us is the `Estimate` (same as above) and the `Std. Error` which quantifies how precise our estimate is.  Two standard errors is (roughly) the same as a **95% Confidence Interval**.   Thus, the slope on this fit is 33.2 new sea otters / year &pm; 6.18.  This is definitely bigger than 0!  We can also see that because the *p*-value (under column `Pr(>|t|)`) is very very very very small.  

Note, also that $R^2 = 0.835$.  $R^2$ is between 0 and 1 and measures how tight the fit is, specifically it is the *proportion of the variance explained by the model*. 

We can plot this linear model on our data:

```{r}
plot(Year, Count)
abline(Model1)
```

Note, `abline` is a function that adds an intercept-slope line to any existing plot. 

There are some problems with this model.  What are they?  

You can see one issue if you plot the model residuals as follows:

```{r}
plot(Model1,1)
```

Do those residuals look consistently normally distributed? 

## Log Transformation

We kind of knew the growth was not linear (otherwise this week's topic wouldn't have been called *Exponential Growth*).  But how can we use a linear model to fit an exponential growth function?  

With a simple transformation! 

$$\log(Y_i) = \alpha + \beta\, X_i + \epsilon_i$$

How does this relate to an exponential growth model? 

$$e^{\log(Y_i)} = e^{\alpha + \beta\, X_i + \epsilon_i}$$
$$Y_t = N_0  e^{\beta\, X_t + \epsilon_t}$$

We just replaced $e^\alpha$ with $N_0$, and $i$ with $t$.  But $\beta$ is EXACTLY the growth rate $r$ (and $e^\beta = \lambda$).  The $\epsilon_i$ hanging on the end is a bit of stochasticity.  

Anyways, doing this with our linear modeling tools is easy.  We just wrap `Count` in a log.  

```{r}
Model2 <- lm(log(Count) ~ Year)
summary(Model2)
```

Note how our statistics changed.  Specifically: our $\beta$ estimate (which is also $r$) is now 0.07325, which is a good estimate of the intrinsic growth rate.  Even better, we know have a standard error around that estimate: 0.00237, which means our growth rate can be written as:  $\widehat{r} = (7.32 \pm 0.47)\times 10^{-2}$.  We can convert that to an annual growth rate in R as well (*do NOT worry about understanding the following code*:

```{r}
r.hat <- summary(Model2)$coefficients[2,1]
r.sd <- summary(Model2)$coefficients[2,2]
exp(c(r.hat, r.hat-2*r.sd, r.hat+2*r.sd))
```

So our estimate of annual population growth is 7.6% (95% Confidence Interval 7.1%-8.1%)


Note how much right the $R^2$ value is!   This is (by that measure also) a much better fit.  

Let's visualize the fit:

```{r}
plot(Year, log(Count))
abline(Model2)
```

Much better!

Let's make our final graph a little nicer

```{r}
plot(Year, log(Count), main = 'Sea Otter Population', col = 'brown', pch = 4)
abline(Model2, col = "blue")
```

The commands we're using within the `plot` function include setting the title of the graph (`main =`), changing the color of the symbols and the line (`col =`), and changing the shape of the symbols (`pch =`). There also many more alterations you can make to get your graph perfect - but that can be a deep dark `R`abbit hole!

### Check Your New Residuals

```{r}
plot(Model2, 1)
```

These look better!  (Though it takes practice to understand good vs. bad residuals.)



## Extra packages (extra material)

It can be a bit fussy to plot the confidence interval around our prediction.  Below, we include a little snippet of code which does just that, but you have to install a new "library" called `ggplot2`, which has a bunch of fancier graphing tools. 

To install a library, you use the `install.packages()` function: 
```{r eval = FALSE, warnings=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

You only need to install a package once on your computer. After that, it will always be there.

Alternatively, you can use the `R` interface to install new packages. To do so:

> Click the `Packages` tab in the bottom right window of `Rstudio`

> Click `Install`

> Leave the defaults in place; in the blank "packages" line, type the name of the package you want. `RStudio` should automatically fill this in with suggestions. Use a comma to separate the names of multiple package if installing more than one simultaneously. 

> Click `Install`

This will automatically put the correct code in the console for you. 

From now on, whenever you need that package loaded you use the `library` function. You only have to do this once each time you open `R`, after that, a package stays in your library for the rest of your session.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

If you receive prewritten code from someone and open the file in `RStudio`, the software will automatically identify packages called by the `library` funtion. If you do not have these packages installed, `Rstudio` will ask you if you'd like to install them, which can save you time. However, you will still need to run the `library` function on each package before you can use them.

Now - **finally** - you have access to the funky / fancy library of ggplotting functions.  For example: 

```{r}
ggplot(SeaOtters, aes(Year, Count)) + geom_point() + 
    stat_smooth(method = "glm", 
                method.args = list(family = gaussian(link = "log")))
```

This really looks like a nice fit!

The two sciurid species Squirlicorn (*Sciurus monocerus*) and winged Pegamunk (*Neotamias pegasus*, see figure above) are direct competitors for limited spatial resources.  They feed on rainbows, or some such thing. When provoked, a squirlicorn will skewer the pegamunk on its horn. Pegamunks will return the favor by grabbing the squirlicorn by its little shoulders and dropping from a very high elevation.  None of this is pretty (though it can be colorful). 

Under some conditions, the species find ways to coexist. But it can be a challenge to find those.  

## To use the simulator below ...

- Set all the parameters of population growth and competition
- Click on the `May the battle begin` button
- Scroll through time - but clicking on the time entry and hitting "up" and "down" arrows, or just let it display some high value (maximum 400).
- Adjust parameters and re-run simulation at will.
